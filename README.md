# Garage Opened

Garage Opener application

## Introduction

This project contains what is needed to build a Garage Opener application.
I created my own Garage Opener board using a Particle Photon board. This application

The application is built using PhoneGap. This means that the application could potentially run on any platform.
At this time, I have verified the application only on Android devices.

Since the application is built with PhoneGap, it's entire coded in HTML, JavaScript and CSS, with the only addition of the files required by PhoneGap and the necessary icons for Android.

If you are interested in details of the project, contact me directly. I plan to make a tutorial available sometime in the future, but I have not completed that yet.
